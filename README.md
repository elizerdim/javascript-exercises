# JavaScript Exercises

These are some of the algorithm exercises that I completed to practice my JavaScript skills. They are from various resources such as freeCodeCamp, the Odin Project, LeetCode, JavaScript30, and Eloquent JavaScript.

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

## Useful resources

- [sort()](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_sort.asp) - sort() converts the elements of the array into strings and sorts them alphabetically in ascending order, mutating the array. Use sort((a, b) => a - b) to sort numerical values in ascending order or sort((a, b) => b - a) for descending order.
- [break/continue](https://javascript.info/while-for#breaking-the-loop) - 'break' exits the loop before the condition becomes falsy. 'continue' exits the current iteration and starts the next iteration without running the remaining code inside the code block.
